# Introduction

## Title: Restor-ation

## What? \(The need\)

A cogent, well-sourced, biblically-grounded, evangelistic theological treatise showing that the Sabbath is at the heart of the gospel, by showing that the essence of the gospel is restoration. A high-quality book for sharing with non-Adventist pastors or theologically literate laity.

## How? \(The book\)
